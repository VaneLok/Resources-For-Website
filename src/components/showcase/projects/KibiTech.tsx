                    This was my thesis project and one of the most meaningful experiences in my design journey. The challenge was to redesign a heritage building into an inclusive, fully accessible workplace for Kibitech Inc., a company with plans to employ a neurodiverse team. My role focused entirely on interior design, and the mission was to build a space that supports independence, collaboration, and well-being for people with developmental and cognitive disabilities.

                <br />
                <p>
                    From the start, the vision was to blend neuroscience, universal design, and technology in a way that felt natural, never clinical. We assumed half of the team would require cognitive accommodations, which meant the interiors had to be intuitive and deeply human.

                    Layouts were designed with flexibility and flow, and spaces were softened with curves to reduce visual stress. Research from neuroscientist Oshin Vartanian guided many of these decisions, showing that curvilinear forms bring harmony and calm.

                <p>
                    To support wayfinding and memory, I created sensory landmarks throughout the office. One room became a forest-inspired space, filled with greenery, textured surfaces, and warm lighting that offered a sense of grounded focus.

                    Another was centered around the idea of water, offering softer light levels, a curved privacy wall, and ambient sounds like rainfall to encourage rest and reflection. Each zone had a distinct identity while still feeling part of a cohesive whole.

                    Nature continued to shape the space through green walls, a central terrarium, daylight-mimicking fixtures, and furniture chosen for its organic feel. In the reception area, I installed a custom parametric bench that served as a visual anchor and a tactile starting point for navigation.

                    Several hallway columns were wrapped in curved coverings to double as grip-friendly landmarks for support and orientation. Every aspect of the design met the standards of the Ontario Building Code, the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, and heritage preservation guidelines.

                    More importantly, it reflected the four principles of universal design I worked from: equitable use, perceptible information, intuitive navigation, and flexibility.

                    Kibitech was never just about designing an office. It was about creating a workplace where everyone can thrive, connect, and feel seen. The experience deepened my passion for design that prioritizes people, and it continues to inspire how I think about accessibility and inclusion in every project I take on.
